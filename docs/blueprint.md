## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep and trustworthy green (#3A6A3A), derived from the logo, to inspire confidence and stability.
- Background color: Clean and neutral off-white/light gray (#F5F5F5), to provide a calming and accessible backdrop.
- Accent color: Warm and optimistic gold (#D4A03C), also derived from the logo, to highlight important elements and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) to ensure readability for elderly users. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Maintain a stable and consistent layout that echoes the infinity symbol in the Avantages Collectifs logo, using clear and predictable navigation.
- Avoid icons without text labels, ensure all interactive elements have large touch targets (at least 48x48px).
- Avoid flashy animations, use subtle transitions and feedback to enhance usability without overwhelming users.
